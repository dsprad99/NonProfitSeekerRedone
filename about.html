            <p class="aboutText" style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Nonprofit Seeker is an award winning Hack@Davidson project that won the Technology for
                                 Best Use award. The problem with nonprofit organizations is there is no guarnteed way to 
                                 know where your money is going. At the end of every year nonprofits must submit a tax form 
                                 called the Form 990 which the IRS puts into a CSV file that the public can download. However within the CSV file there
                                 is tons of columns of data that are very complicated to read. The overall goal of Nonprofit 
                                 seeker was to allow for the public to be able to easily, readily, and effeciently look at this 
                                 data in an oganized way with a rating algorithm.

                                 This is a redone version of Nonprofit Seeker that has been done using PHP and MySQL to allow for 
                                 more data to be displayed and used. Before in our previous version of Nonprofit Seeker we used 
                                 Javascript, HTML, and CSS to display this data and did all of our calculations in Python using 
                                 Jupyter Notebook. However a much more effecient way of doing this was using SQL and PHP to allow 
                                 us to display 5,960 more nonprofits for users to view.
